The following link contains the information I used to create a service

https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/136972/python-script-stops-mysteriously-after-a-few-hours

1) Create the service file
2) Copy it to /etc/systemd/system

To start the service
sudo systemctl start water.service

To check the status of the services:
sudo systemctl status water.service

To stop the service
sudo systemctl stop water.service


You need to do this if you change the file:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
